### Group A
1. [**Assignment 2**  - Write a Python program to store marks scored in subject “Fundamental of Data Structure” by N students in the class. Write functions to compute following:
a) The average score of class 
b) Highest score and lowest score of class 
c) Count of students who were absent for the test
d) Display mark with highest frequency](https://github.com/mokalyogesh113/DSL/tree/main/Ass%20A-2)
<br><br>

2. [**Assignment 4**  -  Write a Python program that computes the net amount of a bank account based a transaction log from console input. The transaction log format is shown as following: D 100 W 200 (Withdrawal is not allowed if balance is going negative. Write functions for withdraw and deposit) D means deposit while W means withdrawal. Suppose the following input is supplied to the program: 
D 300 
D 300 
W 200 
D 100 
Then, the output should be: 500](https://github.com/mokalyogesh113/DSL/tree/main/Ass%20A-4)

b) To determines the frequency of occurrence of particular character in the string
c) To check whether given string is palindrome or not 
d) To display index of first appearance of the substring
e) To count the occurrences of each word in a given string](https://github.com/mokalyogesh113/DSL/tree/main/Ass%20A-5)
<br><br>

4. [**Assignment 9**  - Write a python program to compute following computation on matrix:
